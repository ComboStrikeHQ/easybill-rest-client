# easybill-rest-client [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/ad2games/easybill-rest-client/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ad2games/easybill-rest-client/tree/master)

A client library for the Easybill REST API, generated using
[swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

In order to (re-)generate the library, run `script/generate`, which will
run the generator and put the result into `tmp/easybill-rest-client`. 
The version number and a few other configuration options for the
generator can be found in `config.json`.
